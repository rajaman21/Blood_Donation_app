# Abstract:
A blood bank plays a vital role in ensuring safe and timely blood transfusions, but traditional systems relying on paperwork are inefficient during emergencies. The goal of this cloud-based blood bank system is to provide quick access to blood, even in urgent situations. The Online Blood Bank project maintains detailed information on donors and organizations, allowing individuals and groups to register easily. It uses machine learning to track the real-time locations of nearby blood donors and hospitals, saving time and improving efficiency. This system addresses the imbalance between blood supply and demand, finds suitable donors in emergencies, and enhances data privacy. Designed as an Android app, it manages daily transactions and helps users find donors, offering alternative contact information and ultimately aiding in life-saving situations.
